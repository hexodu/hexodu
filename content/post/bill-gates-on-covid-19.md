   In any crisis, leaders have two equally important responsibilities:
   solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again. The
   Covid-19 pandemic is a case in point. We need to save lives now while
   also improving the way we respond to outbreaks in general. The first
   point is more pressing, but the second has crucial long-term
   consequences.

   The long-term challenge -- improving our ability to respond to
   outbreaks -- isn't new. Global health experts have been saying for
   years that another pandemic whose speed and severity rivaled those of
   the 1918 influenza epidemic was a matter not of if but of when.^1 The
   Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed substantial resources
   in recent years to helping the world prepare for such a scenario.

   Now we also face an immediate crisis. In the past week, Covid-19 has
   started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we've been
   worried about. I hope it's not that bad, but we should assume it will
   be until we know otherwise.

   There are two reasons that Covid-19 is such a threat. First, it can
   kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health
   problems. The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality
   risk around 1%; this rate would make it many times more severe than
   typical seasonal influenza, putting it somewhere between the 1957
   influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).^2

   Second, Covid-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected
   person spreads the disease to two or three others -- an exponential
   rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be
   transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic.^3
   That means Covid-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East
   respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which
   were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people. In
   fact, Covid-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS in a
   quarter of the time.

   National, state, and local governments and public health agencies can
   take steps over the next few weeks to slow the virus's spread. For
   example, in addition to helping their own citizens respond, donor
   governments can help low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) prepare
   for this pandemic.^4 Many LMIC health systems are already stretched
   thin, and a pathogen like the coronavirus can quickly overwhelm them.
   And poorer countries have little political or economic leverage, given
   wealthier countries' natural desire to put their own people first.

   By helping African and South Asian countries get ready now, we can save
   lives and slow the global circulation of the virus. (A substantial
   portion of the commitment Melinda and I recently made to help kickstart
   the global response to Covid-19 -- which could total up to $100 million
   -- is focused on LMICs.)

   The world also needs to accelerate work on treatments and vaccines for
   Covid-19.^5 Scientists sequenced the genome of the virus and developed
   several promising vaccine candidates in a matter of days, and the
   Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is already preparing up
   to eight promising vaccine candidates for clinical trials. If some of
   these vaccines prove safe and effective in animal models, they could be
   ready for larger-scale trials as early as June. Drug discovery can also
   be accelerated by drawing on libraries of compounds that have already
   been tested for safety and by applying new screening techniques,
   including machine learning, to identify antivirals that could be ready
   for large-scale clinical trials within weeks.

   All these steps would help address the current crisis. But we also need
   to make larger systemic changes so we can respond more efficiently and
   effectively when the next epidemic arrives.

   It's essential to help LMICs strengthen their primary health care
   systems. When you build a health clinic, you're also creating part of
   the infrastructure for fighting epidemics. Trained health care workers
   not only deliver vaccines; they can also monitor disease patterns,
   serving as part of the early warning systems that alert the world to
   potential outbreaks.

   We also need to invest in disease surveillance, including a case
   database that is instantly accessible to relevant organizations, and
   rules requiring countries to share information. Governments should have
   access to lists of trained personnel, from local leaders to global
   experts, who are prepared to deal with an epidemic immediately, as well
   as lists of supplies to be stockpiled or redirected in an emergency.

   In addition, we need to build a system that can develop safe, effective
   vaccines and antivirals, get them approved, and deliver billions of
   doses within a few months after the discovery of a fast-moving
   pathogen. That's a tough challenge that presents technical, diplomatic,
   and budgetary obstacles, as well as demanding partnership between the
   public and private sectors. But all these obstacles can be overcome.

   One of the main technical challenges for vaccines is to improve on the
   old ways of manufacturing proteins, which are too slow for responding
   to an epidemic. We need to develop platforms that are predictably safe,
   so regulatory reviews can happen quickly, and that make it easy for
   manufacturers to produce doses at low cost on a massive scale. For
   antivirals, we need an organized system to screen existing treatments
   and candidate molecules in a swift and standardized manner.

   Another technical challenge involves constructs based on nucleic acids.
   These constructs can be produced within hours after a virus's genome
   has been sequenced; now we need to find ways to produce them at scale.

   Beyond these technical solutions, we'll need diplomatic efforts to
   drive international collaboration and data sharing. Developing
   antivirals and vaccines involves massive clinical trials and licensing
   agreements that would cross national borders. We should make the most
   of global forums that can help achieve consensus on research priorities
   and trial protocols so that promising vaccine and antiviral candidates
   can move quickly through this process. These platforms include the
   World Health Organization R&D Blueprint, the International Severe Acute
   Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium trial network, and the
   Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness. The
   goal of this work should be to get conclusive clinical trial results
   and regulatory approval in 3 months or less, without compromising
   patients' safety.

   Then there's the question of funding. Budgets for these efforts need to
   be expanded several times over. Billions more dollars are needed to
   complete phase 3 trials and secure regulatory approval for coronavirus
   vaccines, and still more funding will be needed to improve disease
   surveillance and response.

   Government funding is needed because pandemic products are
   extraordinarily high-risk investments; public funding will minimize
   risk for pharmaceutical companies and get them to jump in with both
   feet. In addition, governments and other donors will need to fund -- as
   a global public good -- manufacturing facilities that can generate a
   vaccine supply in a matter of weeks. These facilities can make vaccines
   for routine immunization programs in normal times and be quickly
   refitted for production during a pandemic. Finally, governments will
   need to finance the procurement and distribution of vaccines to the
   populations that need them.

   Billions of dollars for antipandemic efforts is a lot of money. But
   that's the scale of investment required to solve the problem. And given
   the economic pain that an epidemic can impose -- we're already seeing
   how Covid-19 can disrupt supply chains and stock markets, not to
   mention people's lives -- it will be a bargain.

   Finally, governments and industry will need to come to an agreement:
   during a pandemic, vaccines and antivirals can't simply be sold to the
   highest bidder. They should be available and affordable for people who
   are at the heart of the outbreak and in greatest need. Not only is such
   distribution the right thing to do, it's also the right strategy for
   short-circuiting transmission and preventing future pandemics.

   These are the actions that leaders should be taking now. There is no
   time to waste.
