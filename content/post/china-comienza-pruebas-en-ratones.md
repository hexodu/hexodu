Chinese scientists have begun animal trials as they seek to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, Chinese media outlet Yicai reported Monday.

Samples of the new vaccine were injected into more than 100 healthy mice on Sunday, and if the trials go well, the new vaccine could enter human clinical trials as soon as April, Yicai reported, citing multiple sources including an official from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or China CDC.

“This is still at a very early stage, and there are still many steps to be taken before it can be used on humans,” the official was quoted as saying.

The vaccine has been designed and developed by the China CDC, Tongji University School of Medicine and the Siwei (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co.

Calls to China CDC, Tongji University and Siwei were not immediately answered.
